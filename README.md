# Cardiovascular-Disease
Classification and cluster analysis of patients with cardiovascular disease

This project consists of:
1) a classification model using EMR data to predict whether patients have cardiovascular disease
2) a cluster analysis to group patients by common root causes/ manifestations of cardiovascular disease in order to develop disease management programs to address their specific needs

The repo contains:
1) Slide deck presentation discussing data sources, methodology, and findings (Cardiovascular Disease Patient Models.pdf)
2) Jupyter Notebook file containing code used to build the models (Cardiovascular Disease Modeling.ipynb)
3) .pdf version of the Jupyter Notebook (Cardiovascular Disease Modeling.pdf)
