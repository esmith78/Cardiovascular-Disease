# Cardiovascular-Disease
Classification and cluster analysis of patients with cardiovascular disease

This project consists of:
1) a classification model using EMR data to predict whether patients have cardiovascular disease
2) a cluster analysis to group patients by common root causes/ manifestations of cardiovascular disease in order to develop disease management programs to address their specific needs

The repo contains .pdf versions of a PowerPoint presentation discussing data sources, methodology, and findings as well as a Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used to build the models.
